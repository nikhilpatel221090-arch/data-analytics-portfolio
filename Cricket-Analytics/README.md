# 🏏 Cricket Analytics Dashboard

### 📌 Problem
Sports analysts need quick insights into player performance across runs, averages, and strike rates.

### ✅ Solution
I built a Cricket Analytics Dashboard with:
- Total runs by player
- Strike rate comparison
- Batting averages
- Run contribution pie chart

### 🚀 Results
The dashboard highlights top players and key performance metrics for better analysis.
