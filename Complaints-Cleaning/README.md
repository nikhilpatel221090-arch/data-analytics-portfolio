# 🐍 Customer Complaints Cleaning

### 📌 Problem
Raw customer complaints data often contains duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.

### ✅ Solution
I cleaned the data using Python:
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values
- Standardized columns (CustomerID, Complaint, Satisfaction)

### 🚀 Results
Produced a clean dataset ready for analysis, with a dashboard showing complaint trends and satisfaction scores.
